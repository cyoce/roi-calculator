  <div><!-- part 1 -->
    <p>
      Part 1: First, let's establish the baseline cost of your development team focused on
      CX systems and applications:
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>How many of your Development Staff are focused on your CX systems and applications?</p>
      <input id='num-dev-staff' type='number' class='calc-input'/>

     <p>What is the average salary of these staff? (the industry average is $100,000)</p>
      <input id='average-salary' type='number' class='calc-input'/>

      <p>What is your overhead? (the industry average is 2.2)</p>
      <input id='overhead' type='number' class='calc-input'/>

      <p>Estimated Cost:</p>
      <span id='estimated-cx-cost'>--</span>
    </div>

  <div><!-- part 2 -->
    <p>
      Part 2: Unplanned work is a major constraint in development.
      On average, most software development teams face 50% unplanned work,
      leaving only 50% of their time for productive work.
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>
        How much unplanned work do you estimate your team faces?
        (the industry average is 50%)
      </p>
      <input id='unplanned-work' type='number' class='calc-input'/>%

      <p>Your Maximum Capacity:</p>
      <span id='hours-capacity'>--</span>

      <p>Development capacity lost to unplanned work:</p>
      <span id='capacity-lost'>--</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <br>
    <div><!-- part 3 -->
    <p>
      Part 3: Testing is a major constraint in the development process. By automating testing,
      you can reduce cycle time for a release. On average, you can reduce cycle time by 40%
      by automating testing. This means that, with the same resources, you can accomplish more.
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>Your Current Capacity:</p>
      <span id='current-capacity'>--</span>
      <p>Total new output:</p>
      <span id='new-output-cycle'>--</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div> <!-- part 4 -->
    <p>Part 4: Reduction of unplanned work.</p>
    <p>
      By improving quality, you can reduce unplanned work.
      Our services can reduce it by 50%, increasing your total capacity.
     </p>
    <p>Total new output:</p>
